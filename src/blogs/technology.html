            For my Senior Year of highschool, I participated in the Technology
            Innovations Course. The goal of this course was to introduce current
            software development standards and to create a space for techonolgy
            innovation. Five different groups were formed to work on various
            applications, such as, social media, games, and fitness apps. My
            group consisted of five classmates and worked on a finess app titled
            BikeJog. For this projects development we utilized github and an
            Agile development style with scrums and sprints. Within this
            developer group, I focued on fullstack development; primarily
            dealing with implementing the database as well as a goals page. I
            implemented google's realtime firebase; a NoSQL database.
            Additionally, I took charge in resolving any github merging
            conflicts or issues in the repo. Overall, I learned a lot about the
            software development process, programming in a group, and discovered
            my love for fullstack development.
