          For my Senior Year of highschool, I participated in the Technology Innovations Course. 
          The goal of this course was to introduce current software development standards and to 
          create a space for techonolgy innovation. Five different groups were formed and worked on
          various applications, such as social media, games, and fitness apps. My group consisted of
          five classmates and we worked on a finess app titled BikeJog. For this projects development
          we utilized github and a Agile development style with scrums and sprints. Within this developer 
          group, I focued on fullstack development; primarily dealing with implementing the database 
          as well as a goals page. I implemented google's realtime firebase; a NoSQL database.
