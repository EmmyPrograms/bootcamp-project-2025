          In the Summer of 2025, I participated in the JumpStart program at Cal
          Poly. The Jumpstart program is a programmed offered to incoming
          transfer students who major in ME, CS, and SWE in an effort to curve
          the phenomenon known as "transfer shock". Transfer shock refers to the
          intense drop in GPA transfer students experience when they first
          transfer to a new college. The program was 5 Weeks and covered topics
          such as Algorithms, On-Campus Resources, Club and social life on
          campus, as well as workshops to fill in any gaps of knowledge transfer
          students may have. Within this program, I gained a strong base in
          algoritm design and analysis, ineterests in the club Hack4Impact,
          resouces to help me succeed at cal poly, and my tight knit community
          of friends and peers. Overall, I'm incredibly greatful for the
          Jumpstart Program and the impact it had on my transition to Cal Poly.
