            In the Summer of 2025, I participated in the JumpStart program at
            Cal Poly. The Jumpstart program is a programmed offered to incoming
            transfer students who major in ME, CS, and SWE in an effort to curve
            the phenomenon known as "transfer shock". Transfer shock refers to
            the intense drop in GPA transfer students experience when they first
            transfer to a new college. The program was 5 Weeks and covered
            topics such as Algorithms, On-Campus Resources, Club and social life
            on campus, as well as workshops to fill in any gaps of knowledge
            transfer students may have. Within this program, I gained a strong
            base in algoritm design and analysis, ineterests in the club
            Hack4Impact, resouces to help me succeed at cal poly, and my tight
            knit community of friends and peers. Overall, I'm incredibly
            greatful for the Jumpstart Program and the impact it had on my
            transition to Cal Poly.
